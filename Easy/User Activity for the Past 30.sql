1141. User Activity for the Past 30 Days I
 
Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input: 
Activity table:
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
Output: 
+------------+--------------+ 
| day        | active_users |
+------------+--------------+ 
| 2019-07-20 | 2            |
| 2019-07-21 | 2            |
+------------+--------------+ 

SOLUTION:

SELECT ACTIVITY_DATE AS DAY, COUNT(DISTINCT USER_ID) AS ACTIVE_USERS
FROM ACTIVITY
WHERE (ACTIVITY_DATE > '2019-06-27' AND ACTIVITY_DATE <='2019-07-27')
GROUP BY ACTIVITY_DATE;
